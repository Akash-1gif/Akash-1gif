<h1 align="center">Hello... My name is Akash and I know that no one cares about this section</h1>

<p> Some stuff about this * DEAD * user: </p>

- A messed up evil genius who was capable of achieving the impossible 

- An ENTJ (INTJ to be precise) by birth, but due to societal pressure and the factual world: this kid grew up to become an ISFP (or ISFJ, who sucks)

- I need to push my superior projects, but due to my unconventional comments, I held them back (TBH no one would care about them as I left programming and life which was meant to be lived happily (Although it involves some serious ML, AI and Mathematical tasks)

- Due to GDPR compliances, I wish to protect my data (TBH I don't like sharing my contact information as I'm not interested in interacting with anyone regarding anything. I'm done with people and I don't want anyone new in my life). But yes, you can invite me to play NFS, Fall Guys, and Asserto Corsa. I have shared my Steam account link. Would get into Forza Horizon 5 soon - if I could survive today

- Current Activity: <b> Researching Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, training ML models using encrypted data, investigating methods to train ML models with encrypted data, and evaluating their performance </b>
